# ReactExpressTinkering
Some tinkering with React and Express/Node.js

---

## What is this?
This is a simple full stack web app with a frontend in React and a backend in Express running on Node.js.

The frontend also uses React Router (for client-side routing) and React Bootstrap (a React component library).

The backend uses Axios to execute HTTP requests to other API endpoints.

## How to run
After pulling the code down to your local machine, `cd` into the `client` directory and run `npm install`. Then, `cd` into
the `server` directory and run `npm install`.

In the `server` directory, run `npm start` in a terminal.
In a separate terminal, `cd` into the `client` directory and run `npm start`.

The output in the terminal with the `client` directory should say where the frontend/client server is visitable at.
